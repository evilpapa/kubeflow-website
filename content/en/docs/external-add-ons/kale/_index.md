Kale simplifies the use of Kubeflow, giving data scientists the tool they need to orchestrate end-to-end ML workflows. Kale provides a UI in the form of a JupyterLab extension. You can annotate cells in Jupyter Notebooks to define: pipeline steps, hyperparameter tuning, GPU usage, and metrics tracking. Click a button to create pipeline components and KFP DSL, resolve dependencies, inject data objects into each step, deploy the data science pipeline, and serve the best model.
